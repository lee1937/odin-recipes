        <p>A long time ago I had lasagna. Well I have had lasagna a lot. And not that long ago either because my family always has it for Christmas. Bit</p>
        <p>of a weird tradition that one. Either way I certainly did not steal this recipe from AllRecipes. Or something like that. Who cares</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine your meats, onion, and garlic in a dutch oven over medium heat. Not a pair of sheets you fart between, an actual one you goof.</li>
          <li>Once that stuff is browned stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste (YES THIS IS NECESSARY), and water</li>
          <li>Season with sugar (yes really), basil, fennel seeds, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parsley</li>
          <li>Simmer that sucker for about 1.5 hours. Give it a stir and a whiff every now and then</li>
          <li>salt some water and boil it. Cook your lasagna noodles (yes they are called that)</li>
          <li>Ok I think this exercise has gone on long enough. Drain it, mix w/ ricotta, egg, and parsley</li>
          <li>spread everything out on a baking dish. layer it. bake @ 375 for 25 w/ foil, then 25 w/out. </li> 
        </ol>
