        <p>Our Crockpot Apple Crisp With Oatmeal is a perfect marriage of tender, juicy apples and a sweet and salty crisp. The edges caramelize and set really</p>
        <p>nicely, while the center finishes crisping right at the end. It's got that traditional flavor everyone loves, and best of all, it's super easy. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Combine oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, 1 cup of the flour, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt in a medium bowl.</li>
          <li>Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles small peas.</li>
          <li>Combine apples, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tablespoons flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.</li>
          <li>Transfer apple mixture to a lightly greased (with cooking spray) 6-quart slow cooker.</li>
          <li>Evenly distribute oats mixture over apple mixture.</li>
          <li>Place paper towels over top of slow cooker extending over rim; then cover with lid.</li>
          <li>Cook on HIGH until apples are tender and oats mixture is caramelized around edges and crispy, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
