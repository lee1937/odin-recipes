        <h1>A Breakfast Casserole! Or Strata! I am not sure what a strata is</h1>
        <h2>It has a bunch of stuff in it but it isn't a fritatta?</h2>
        <img src="images/strata.jpeg" alt="Spinach, Bacon, and Gruyere Breakfast Casserole">
        <h2>Oh specifically it has Spinach, Bacon, and Gruyere (I don't know how to do an accent in html)</h2>
        <p>The copy paste begins! This dish has fewer than 20g of total carbs--about half of what you'll find in classic bread-based casseroles</p>
        <p>Greek yogurt, eggs, and cheese pack a mighty protein punch, while a touch of bacon seasons to perfection. The strata is best if allowed to soak overnight.</p>
        <p>Not only does this build in make-ahead convenience, it also allows the bread to fully absorb the egg mixture--yielding a creamy texture inside, while the top bread pieces get delightfully crisp. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium until crisp, about 6 minutes. </li>
          <li>Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving 1 1/2 tablespoons drippings in skillet; discard any remaining drippings. Finely chop bacon; set aside.</li>
          <li>Add onion and garlic to drippings in skillet over medium-high heat; cook, stirring occa­sionally, until onion is browned and tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add spinach; cook until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Toss together chopped bacon, onion mixture, bread cubes, and cheese in a large bowl.</li>
          <li>Arrange mixture evenly in an 8-inch square glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray.</li>
          <li>Combine milk, yogurt, eggs, egg whites, mustard, pepper, and salt in a large bowl; stir with a whisk until well combined.</li>
          <li>Pour evenly over bread mixture. Cover and chill 8 hours or overnight.</li> 
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Uncover baking dish; let strata stand at room temperature as oven preheats.</li>
          <li>Bake strata in preheated oven until top of strata is browned and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let strata stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
